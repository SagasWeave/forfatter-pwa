# File ID API Directory

This directory contains the dynamic API endpoints for managing individual file content in the Forfatter PWA application.

## File Structure

```
[id]/
└── route.ts            # File API endpoints for specific file ID
```

## Dynamic Routing

This directory implements Next.js dynamic routing for file operations. The `[id]` segment in the path represents the unique identifier of a specific file.

## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/file/[id]`
Retrieves the content of a specific file by its ID.

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "content": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "updated_at": "timestamp"
}
```

### PUT `/api/file/[id]`
Updates the content of a specific file.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "content": "string",
  "title": "string"
}
```

### DELETE `/api/file/[id]`
Deletes a specific file.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": "boolean",
  "message": "string"
}
```

## Design System Integration

The data structures returned by these endpoints are designed to work well with MUI components:
- Content strings that can be displayed in MUI text editors
- Metadata that can be shown in MUI info components
- Error responses that can be displayed in MUI alert components
- Timestamps that can be formatted using MUI date utilities

## Error Handling

All endpoints follow consistent error response patterns that can be displayed in MUI alert components:

```json
{
  "error": "string",
  "message": "string"
}
```

## Future Development

When extending these endpoints:
1. Maintain consistency with existing data structures
2. Ensure new functionality works well with MUI data display components
3. Follow REST conventions
4. Implement proper TypeScript typing
5. Consider caching strategies for better performance
