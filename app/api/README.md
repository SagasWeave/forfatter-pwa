# API Directory

This directory contains all the backend API routes for the Forfatter PWA application, implemented using Next.js API routes.

## Directory Structure

```
api/
├── tree/               # Document structure management
│   └── route.ts        # Tree API endpoints
├── file/               # File content operations
│   └── [id]/           # Dynamic route for file operations
│       └── route.ts    # File API endpoints
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Design System Alignment

While this directory contains backend functionality rather than UI components, it plays an important role in supporting the MUI-based design system by providing the data that MUI components will display:

### Data Structure Consistency
The API endpoints return data in formats that are optimized for MUI components:
- Consistent JSON structures that map well to MUI data display components
- Proper error handling that can be displayed in MUI alert components
- Pagination and filtering options that work with MUI table components

### Integration with React Query
The API is designed to work seamlessly with React Query, which is the data fetching library used in the MUI-based frontend:
- Endpoints support caching strategies
- Error responses follow consistent patterns
- Loading states are designed to work with MUI skeleton components

## API Routes

### Tree API (`/api/tree`)
Manages the document structure operations:
- GET: Retrieve the document tree structure
- POST: Create new nodes in the tree
- PUT: Update existing nodes
- DELETE: Remove nodes from the tree

### File API (`/api/file/[id]`)
Handles file content operations:
- GET: Retrieve file content by ID
- PUT: Update file content
- DELETE: Delete file

## Design Principles

1. **RESTful Design**: API endpoints follow REST conventions
2. **Type Safety**: All endpoints use TypeScript for request/response typing
3. **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format for MUI error display components
4. **Performance**: Efficient data retrieval optimized for MUI data components
5. **Security**: Proper validation and sanitization of input data

## Future Development

When adding new API routes:
1. Follow the existing patterns for consistency with MUI frontend components
2. Implement proper TypeScript typing for request/response objects
3. Ensure error responses can be displayed in MUI alert components
4. Consider pagination and filtering for data-heavy endpoints
5. Document new routes in the main [README.md](../../README.md)
